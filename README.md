# Android-Starter-Pack

This is a skeleton android application that you can use to start your awesome Android apps.

It has a navigation drawer to switch between two content layouts and a settings activity built right in!

## A few tips:

Use Android Studio Layout Editor to create your very own user interfaces! See more information at https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html.

Add activities to your app! Think of an activity as a window within your app that displays content with which the user can interact. An activity can take up the entire screen or it could be a simple pop-up. You can choose to use a blank activity and customize it as you wish.
